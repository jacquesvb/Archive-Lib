# Archive Library

The Archive-Lib application allows the user to search archive.org for media and build personalized collections of that media for easy perusal.

## User Experience

The user must register and sign-in, allowing a customized set of collections for each user.

There is a search bar that is used to get a list of identifiers. When an identifier is clicked on, the associated metadata is shown.

There is a save metadata dropdown that allows the user to add the metadata to a current collection or add it to a new collection.

There is a library section which shows links to each piece of media associated to the current collection.
